# Analysis with sinusoidal hypothesis

Trying to reproduce BISHOP 1996 paper on same type of dataset they use (Sinusoidal y(x),
with x^2 variance noise. Fitting both y(x) and the log variance with 4 Gaussian basis
functions.)

## Files

`bishop_quad_gbf.py` - main file. Generates data and does fit

`bishop_quad_gbf_CV.py` - cross validation

`bishop_quad_gbf.ipynb` - ipynb version of main file.

`bishop_quad_gbf_wu_est.py` - estimates ground truth values for gbf weights w and u,
    from ground truth data generated in `bishop_quad_gbf.py`.

`gt.csv`,`loginvvar.csv` - 100 pts ground truth data for 1) hypothesis func, and 2) log
    inverse variance func, each with small uniforms normal noise added, generated by
    `bishop_quad_gbf.py`. Used by `bishop_quad_gbf_wu_est.py` to estimate gt w and u
    weights
